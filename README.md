# MurraySportsApp

This database was created to assist Murray Parks & Recreation in managing their athletic programs. The murraydb_erd file is the ER Diagram which provides a visual representation of the tables and their relationships to eachother. The murraydb file contains the DDL and DML for the database. It is written in MySQL format, and I use MySQL Workbench to run queries. The murraydb_ProcSQL file contains programs that I created to increase the efficiency and functionality of the database.
